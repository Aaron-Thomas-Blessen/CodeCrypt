## Getting Started

To start using Cryptic Canvas, simply follow these steps:

1. Visit our [Website](https://codecrypt-b591f.web.app/) .

2. To signin click on the [Signin](https://codecrypt-b591f.web.app/signin) button on the top right side.
   
3. If you are new then click on the [Join here](https://codecrypt-b591f.web.app/signup) button to signup.
   
4. Now you will be redirected to the [Study page](https://codecrypt-b591f.web.app/study) where you can select which algorithm you want to study like RSA, AES, DES, SHA. It has indepth information about Encryption, Decryption and Key Generation of that particular algorithm along with youtuve videos.
   
5. To Encrypt and Decrypt using Codecrypt click on [Encrypt](https://codecrypt-b591f.web.app/encrypt) or [Decrypt](https://codecrypt-b591f.web.app/decrypt) button.
    
6. In Encrption and Decryption, you can choose from a 5 different types of data encyption and decryption which are text, file, audio, image and video.
    
7. Then select what type of algorithm to use, AES, RSA, DES or SHA.
    
8. Copy the parameters from the encrypt page and send them to your frind for him to try.
    
9. Or use the parameters to find the Encrypted Data.

## How to Do It Yourself

**Do not Skip any steps**

### Requirements
- Firebase
- Node.js and npm
- Windows/Linux

- OpenSSL library
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

###OpenSSL

- Windows:
1. Download from : [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
2. Extract the file
3. Place the extracted openssl file in C:\Program Files

- Ubuntu/linux:
1. Open Terminal
2. Update the Package Lists
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install OpenSSL
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssl
   ```
4. Verify the Installation
   ```bash
   openssl version
   ```
5. Install Development Libraries
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libssl-dev
   ```

The next steps are same for all OS:

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   To get started with CodeCrypt, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aaron-Thomas-Blessen/CodeCrypt.git
   cd CodeCrypt
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Backend:**
